This app was written in Vue.

A stylized version has been generated using a screenshot and AI, but that uses plain JavaScript.

See the code here [plain-js-apps](plain-js-apps) and previews below:

Here were the prompts to extend from the light mode, for dark theme and extended components:

1. _use material theme. choose a dark theme with some eerie corruption and crime busting theme colors and font_
1. _add some more medical equipment and other things important for social wellfare in South Africa_
1. _turn the results in to a table_
